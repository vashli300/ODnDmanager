# ODnDmanager

A simple command-line tool to manage Old-School RPG games.

We will be utilising GTK in the future to implement a cross-platform gui.

Currently in development, help is appreciated.

On Mac/Linux, to build for your platform, run `unix-build.sh`

To build a Windows excecutable from Mac, run `mac-build-win.sh`
